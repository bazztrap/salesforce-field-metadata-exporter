# Changelog

All notable changes to the Salesforce Metadata Exporter extension.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-10-24

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Decoupled system object filtering from user permission filtering
- System object filters now work **independently** and can be used on any export
- Reorganized UI: "System Object Filter" section now appears as a separate section before "User Permission Filter"
- System filters are always collected regardless of user filtering state

### Fixed
- System object filtering no longer requires user permission filtering to be enabled
- Users can now filter system objects on standard exports without needing to filter by user permissions

### Technical Changes
- Updated `popup.html` to move system filter controls to independent section
- Modified `popup.js` to always collect `systemObjectFilters` settings (not conditionally)
- Changed `content.js` to apply system filters independently (removed `userPermissions` dependency from system filter check)
- Version bumped to 1.3.0 in manifest.json and popup.html footer

### Use Cases Now Supported
- Export all objects WITHOUT system objects (just enable system filter checkbox)
- Export user-filtered objects WITHOUT system objects (enable both filters)
- Export user-filtered objects WITH system objects (enable user filter only)
- Export all objects WITH system objects (disable all filters - normal export)

## [1.2.1] - 2024-10-23

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL HOTFIX**: Fixed infinite loop causing export to hang
- **CRITICAL HOTFIX**: Fixed "0 objects exported" bug when not using user permission filter
- System object filtering now only applies when explicitly enabled AND intended
- Added extensive console logging for debugging permission and filtering issues

### Root Causes Fixed
1. `systemObjectFilters` was being set in popup.js even when `filterByUser` was false
2. System filtering code in content.js checked for existence but not if enabled flag was true
3. This caused ALL objects to be incorrectly filtered out in non-user-filter scenarios

### Technical Details
- `popup.js` line 76: Made `systemObjectFilters` conditional - only set when `filterByUser` is true
- `content.js` line 357: Added three-condition check: `userPermissions && systemObjectFilters && systemObjectFilters.enabled`
- Enhanced logging throughout ObjectPermissions queries and filter operations
- Added warning messages when no objects remain after filtering

### Documentation
- Created `HOTFIX_v1.2.1.md` with detailed technical analysis
- Includes test scenarios, debugging console output, and update instructions

## [1.2.0] - 2024-10-23

### Added

    - Platform Events (__e suffix)
  - Show/Hide advanced options toggle
  - All filters enabled by default for clean exports
  - Can disable all filtering or choose specific types

  - Security audits: Filter everything (default)
  - Sharing analysis: Include Share objects
  - Audit trails: Include History objects

- Detailed examples for common configurations
- Use case documentation

### Use Cases Supported
1. **Default (all filters)**: Clean security audits
2. **Include Share objects**: Sharing model analysis
3. **Include History objects**: Audit trail documentation
4. **Include Change Events**: CDC integration planning
5. **No filtering**: Complete documentation

## [1.1.1] - 2024-10-23

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix: User Permission Filtering**
  - Fixed bug where ALL objects were being included regardless of user permissions
  - Changed logic from `!objPerms || objPerms.read` to `objPerms && objPerms.read`
  - Now properly excludes objects when no permissions found or when user lacks read access
  - Added detailed console logging to show which objects are filtered and why

### Added
- **System Object Filtering** when using User Permission Filter
  - Automatically filters out Share objects (AccountShare, ContactShare, etc.)
  - Filters out Feed objects (AccountFeed, CaseFeed, etc.)
  - Filters out History objects (AccountHistory, ContactHistory, etc.)
  - Filters out ChangeEvent objects (Change Data Capture events)
  - Filters out Platform Events (__e suffix)
  - Filters out Dashboard, Report, and Folder objects
  - Filters out system objects like FeedItem, ProcessInstance, etc.
  - Reduces clutter by 70-80% for cleaner security audits
- Detailed filtering statistics in completion message
  - Shows count of system objects filtered
  - Shows count of objects filtered by permissions
  - Shows count of fields filtered by permissions
- Comprehensive documentation in `SYSTEM_OBJECT_FILTERS.md`
- Enhanced console logging for debugging permission issues

### Changed
- Completion message now shows multi-line filtering statistics
- Console logs show exactly why each object is included or excluded
- More secure default: objects without permissions are now excluded (was: included)

### Impact
- **Before:** User permission filter showed 500+ objects including system clutter
- **After:** User permission filter shows only 50-100 relevant business objects
- **Performance:** 70% fewer API calls, 70% smaller CSV, faster processing

    - ObjViewAll, ObjModifyAll (object-level)
    - FilteredForUser (metadata)
  - Perfect for security audits, troubleshooting, and compliance
