```
Required to detect when the user is on a Salesforce page and to inject the content script that handles the export functionality.
```

**host_permissions (*.salesforce.com, *.force.com, etc.):**
```
Required to make API calls to various Salesforce domains (salesforce.com, force.com, cloudforce.com, visualforce.com) to retrieve object and field metadata via Salesforce REST API.
```

---

## Remote Code
```
No - Extension does not load any remote code
```

---

## Data Usage Disclosure

**Does this extension collect user data?**
```
No
```

**Certify:**
- ‚úÖ Extension does not collect, use, or transmit user data
- ‚úÖ Extension does not use or transmit data for purposes unrelated to the extension's functionality
- ‚úÖ Extension does not sell user data

## Notes for Reviewers

```
This extension is a productivity tool for Salesforce administrators and developers.

How it works:
1. User navigates to their Salesforce org
2. User clicks the extension icon and configures export options
3. Extension reads the existing Salesforce session cookie (same approach as Salesforce Inspector)
4. Extension makes API calls to Salesforce REST API to retrieve metadata
5. Extension generates a CSV file locally in the browser
6. CSV file is downloaded to user's computer

No data is collected, stored, or transmitted to any external servers. All processing happens locally in the user's browser.

The extension only works on Salesforce domains and requires an active Salesforce session.

For testing:
- You can use a free Salesforce Developer Edition org: https://developer.salesforce.com/signup
- Log in to the org, then click the extension icon
- The extension will display available export options
```
