# Hotfix v1.2.1 - Fixed Infinite Loop and Zero Objects Bug

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Zero Objects Exported
**Symptom:** "Export completed! 0 objects, 0 fields exported"

**Root Cause:**
- System object filtering was running even when User Permission Filter was disabled
- `systemObjectFilters` was being set in popup.js regardless of filterByUser state
- This caused ALL objects to be filtered out incorrectly

**Fix:**
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
systemObjectFilters: {
  enabled: document.getElementById('filterSystemObjects').checked,
  // ... always set, even when filterByUser is false
}

// NEW (FIXED):
systemObjectFilters: filterByUser ? {
  enabled: document.getElementById('filterSystemObjects').checked,
  // ... only set when filterByUser is true
} : null
```

### Bug 2: System Filtering Applied When It Shouldn't Be
**Symptom:** Objects filtered even without user permissions enabled

**Root Cause:**
- System filtering code checked `if (userPermissions && options.systemObjectFilters)`
- But didn't check if system filtering was actually enabled

**Fix:**
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
if (userPermissions && options.systemObjectFilters) {
  // filters applied even if enabled = false
}

// NEW (FIXED):
if (userPermissions && options.systemObjectFilters && options.systemObjectFilters.enabled) {
  // only filters when explicitly enabled
}
```

## What Was Broken

### Scenario 1: Export WITHOUT User Filter
**Expected:** Export all objects normally
**Actual:** 0 objects exported
**Why:** systemObjectFilters was set but shouldn't apply

### Scenario 2: Export WITH User Filter but System Filter OFF
**Expected:** Export objects based on permissions only
**Actual:** All objects filtered by system filter anyway
**Why:** Didn't check if system filtering was enabled

### Scenario 3: Export WITH User Filter and System Filter ON
**Expected:** Filter system objects AND permission-based filtering
**Actual:** Might work, but logic was unclear

## The Fix

### 1. Only Set systemObjectFilters When Needed
```javascript
const filterByUser = document.getElementById('filterByUser').checked;

const options = {
  // ... other options
  filterByUser: filterByUser,
  // CRITICAL: Only set systemObjectFilters if filtering by user
  systemObjectFilters: filterByUser ? {
    enabled: document.getElementById('filterSystemObjects').checked,
    // ... individual filters
  } : null  // ← null when not filtering by user
};
```

### 2. Check All Conditions Before Filtering
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Check THREE conditions
if (userPermissions &&
    options.systemObjectFilters &&
    options.systemObjectFilters.enabled) {
  // Now safe to apply system object filtering
}
```

### 3. Added Extensive Logging
```javascript
console.log('System object filtering disabled or not applicable');
console.log(`Objects before permission filter: ${beforePermFilter}`);
console.log(`User has read access to ${obj.name}, including`);
console.log(`Found ${result.records.length} ObjectPermissions records`);

if (allObjects.length === 0) {
  console.warn('WARNING: No objects remaining after permission filter!');
  console.warn('Check if ObjectPermissions were retrieved correctly.');
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Normal Export (No User Filter)
```
Steps:
1. Open extension
2. Do NOT check "Filter by User Permissions"
3. Click "Export All Metadata"

Expected: All objects exported normally
Console: "System object filtering disabled or not applicable"
```

### Test 2: User Filter with System Filtering ON
```
Steps:
1. Check "Filter by User Permissions"
2. Enter username
3. "Exclude system objects" should be checked (default)
4. Click "Export All Metadata"

Expected: Only accessible objects, system objects filtered
Console:
- "Applying system object filters..."
- "Filtered out X system objects (Share, Feed, ...)"
- "User has read access to Account, including"
- "Final object count: X objects"
```

### Test 3: User Filter with System Filtering OFF
```
Steps:
1. Check "Filter by User Permissions"
2. Enter username
3. UNCHECK "Exclude system objects"
4. Click "Export All Metadata"

Expected: All accessible objects INCLUDING system ones
Console:
- "System object filtering disabled or not applicable"
- "Final object count: X objects" (higher than Test 2)
```

## How to Update

```bash
# 1. Navigate to extension directory
cd /Users/rohanpoojary/salesforce-metadata-exporter

# 2. Reload extension
# Go to chrome://extensions/
# Click reload button

# 3. Refresh Salesforce page
# Press F5

# 4. Test export
# Try all three test scenarios above
```

## Console Debugging

Open DevTools (F12) and watch for:

**Good Signs:**
```
Salesforce Metadata Exporter: Content script loaded
Initializing Salesforce Metadata Exporter...
System object filtering disabled or not applicable  ← When no user filter
Objects before permission filter: 150
Final object count: 50 objects
```

**Bad Signs:**
```
WARNING: No objects remaining after permission filter!  ← Still broken!
Check if ObjectPermissions were retrieved correctly.
```

**If still broken, check:**
```
Total ObjectPermissions found: 0  ← Problem: No permissions retrieved!
Total unique objects with permissions: 0  ← Problem: User has no access or query failed
```

## What Changed

**Files Modified:**
- `popup.js` - Only set systemObjectFilters when filterByUser is true
- `content.js` - Check enabled flag before applying system filters
- `content.js` - Added extensive logging for debugging
- `manifest.json` - Bumped version to 1.2.1

**Lines Changed:**
- popup.js line 76: Added conditional systemObjectFilters
- content.js line 339: Added `.enabled` check
- content.js line 154-192: Enhanced ObjectPermissions logging
- content.js line 375-405: Enhanced permission filtering logging

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Exports broken without user filter
- ❌ System filtering always applied
- ❌ 0 objects exported in many cases
- ❌ Confusing behavior
- ❌ Poor debugging info

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Normal exports work correctly
- ✅ System filtering only when intended
- ✅ Correct number of objects exported
- ✅ Clear, predictable behavior
- ✅ Extensive console logging for debugging

## Version History

- **v1.2.0:** Added system object filter options
- **v1.2.1:** Fixed critical bugs in filtering logic ← YOU ARE HERE

## Known Issues

None currently. If you still see 0 objects:

1. Check console for warnings
2. Verify ObjectPermissions query returns results
3. Ensure user has at least some object access
4. Try export WITHOUT user filter first to verify basic functionality

## Support

If still broken after this fix:
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Console
2. Copy all logs starting from "Initializing..."
3. Check for ERROR or WARNING messages
4. Report with full console output

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Version:** 1.2.1
